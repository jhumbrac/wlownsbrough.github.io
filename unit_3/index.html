		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>Submit your appilcation by contacting Will below. Simply tell us the outline of your idea, what you think you need in terms of a team, how you see your role in the project (e.g. are you a designer), and whether or not you have any funding. Much like an investor, we review the idea and if it fits with our strategy we will take into account the work required, any financial contriubtion from you and then make you an offer to meet. Following the intial meeting, we may need some more info, but usually look to confirm an offer which includes team provisions and our fee - usually a mix of equity and cash.</p>
