			<h1>STUFF I LOVE</h1>
			<p>I've loved photography, design and architecture for a long time and whilst I'm no architect or designer, I do try and get out to take photos as often as I can. Maybe I'll post some on them on here one day...</p>
			<p>The mountains are my other great love: I am most at home in the snow but love to climb.</p>
