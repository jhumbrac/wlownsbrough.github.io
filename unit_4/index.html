				<h1>RIGHT NOW</h1>
				<p>I work on technology-led innovation for a variety of businesses. My main role is at Starberry where I'm Chief Innovation Officer and responsible for ensuring our innovation capabilities across functions to deliver better results. I also act as technology and innovation advisor to several businesses at different stages. You can learn more about my work life below.</p>

			<h1>WORK LIFE</h1>
			<p>c. 10 years working in amazing startups (some I started and some I joined) across a range of industries: technology, data, property, retail, media, ecommerce and more.</p>
			<p>During these years, I have founded and exited companies, held several senior roles in tech and raised over £2m in funding for ventures. My skill set is broad and combines sound technical knowledge with commercial acumen and ability to get things done. I am straight talking, fast paced, (and apparently) have a tendency to see things or form ideas others don’t.</p>
			<p>Having worked in most levels of business (I stuck stamps on evelopes in my first job), I've been fortunate enough to learn through doing which I feel is invaluable. Previous roles include: Head of Data/MD/CEO/Sales Director/Commercial Director and so on.</p>
			<p>If you're working on something awesome, I'd love to hear about it. Get in touch below.</p>

			<h1>STUFF I LOVE</h1>
			<p>I've loved photography, design and architecture for a long time and whilst I'm no architect or designer, I do try and get out to take photos as often as I can. Maybe I'll post some on them on here one day...</p>
			<p>The mountains are my other great love: I am most at home in the snow but love to climb.</p>
